                    <p>Since the spring semester of 2024, I have worked to research digital ASIC bring-up and validation through ISU Honors' <i>First-Year Mentor Program</i> (FHMP) in collaboration with several peers. Given fabricated SHA-1 ASIC dies designed by a senior design team at ISU several years ago, our task is to perform a full bring-up, verifying the supporting hardware, firmware, and software to determine the overall validity of the design. While the chips proved correct in an exhaustive simulation test suite devised by the team, we sought to determine if these results would carry forward <i>in silico</i>.
    
                    <p>After reviewing the associated Verilog code and probing crucial control signals with a logical analyzer as a preliminary sanity check for the design, I architected a comprehensive verification setup. Inspired by unit test frameworks, I wrote a scalable validation backend in C complete with a conformant SHA1 preprocessor; and, armed with <i>openssl</i>, I scripted an automated fuzzer in Python to rapidly highlight any potential mismatches between known-correct results and what was coming from the chip.
