            <h2>Undergraduate Research under Dr. Henry Duwe</h2>

            <p>Starting in the Spring semester of 2024, I work to research digital ASIC bring-up and validation through ISU Honors' <i>First-Year Mentor Program</i> (FHMP) in collaboration with several peers. Given the physically-unproven fabricated SHA-1 ASIC dies designed by a senior design team at ISU several years ago, our task is to perform a full bring-up, validating the supporting hardware, firmware, and software to determine the validity of the design&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, does their output match the teams' simulation results.</p>
