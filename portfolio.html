                    <h2>Language</h2>
                    <p>Fundamentally, <i>haze</i> is a specification for a fully-custom CPU design that aims to fix many of the long-standing problems with my CL8 design. Architected specifically for simplicity and flexibility, <i>haze</i> avoids unneeded baggage and brings with it suite of support software.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subitem shadowed darken-95">
                    <h2>Compiler</h2>

                    <p>Built atop an entirely custom recursive-descent parser, the <i>haze</i> evaluator supplants my existing simple Titanium compiler. With a substantially more robust frontend, <i>haze</i> makes a number of language-level improvements, and, coupled with a fresh optimizer and code generator, performs far faster comparatively. Despite having been explicitly designed around the <i>haze</i> architecture, I've implemented a custom x86_64 code generator and linker to run <i>haze</i> programs on a wider variety of computers. I'm currently working on a live interpreter to interface with another of my projects, <i>geo</i>, to dynamically script content within the runtime of that engine.

                    <h2>Interpreter</h2>
                    <p>Designed to interface with my latest OpenGL-accelerated 3-D voxel renderer project, <i>geo</i>, the interpreter will ultimately control key engine functionality dynamically through a series of commands paralleling those of the <i>haze</i> compiler and intrinsics designed to hook reference data that control things as simple as geometry diffuse color or a complex as player interactions. Running asynchronously on another thread, the interpreter periodically handshakes the engine to pass across data using a custom loopback-like inter-process communication protocol.</p>

                    <h2>Emulator</h2>
                    <p>Designed to provide rapid feedback about <i>haze</i> machine code program execution and performance, the emulator implements the <i>haze</i> instruction set architecture in a low-overhead software environment to offer an execution throughput nearing one hundred thousand instructions per second. With live data watches and on-the-fly disassembly, the emulator serves an excellent role to smoke-test programs before generating a hex file for the much bulkier and slower Verilog simulator implementation.</p>

                        <p>Titanium is my very own low-level programming language that exclusively exists to support my CL8 binary platform.

                    <h3>Rasterization</h3>
			        <p>In a bid to uncover the technologies that power video games, I learned about linear algebra and rendering pipelines to ultimately develop my own software-accelerated <a href="https://github.com/connorjlink/Constexpr-Linear-Algebra-Library">rasterizer</a>, which features face-based shading and a first-person camera perspective.</p>

                    <h3>Ray Tracing</h3>
			        <p>While researching alternative rendering techniques, ray tracing, the process of physically simulating light rays and their interactions with objects in a scene cropped up. Curious, I wound up creating my own <a href="https://github.com/connorjlink/raytracer">ray tracer</a>. Over time, I have <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLysYOhmJ8m4HtMHV_-bgpvlcGxbd_jYvO">implemented more features</a>, including first-person camera controls, reflections, soft shadows, and global illumination.</p>

                    <h3>Hardware Accelerated Voxels</h3>
                    <p>To improve upon the existing software-accelerated rasterizer and ray tracer programs, I wrote an OpenGL-based voxel-rendering program in C++ called <i>geo</i>. The renderer features geometry pre-generation, vertex batching, and indexed instancing to create an efficiency-oriented product.</p>
